<div>The blogosphere is not good at advancing economic theory. Unsurprising you may say, but just so we're clear.</div><div><br /></div><div>Something that the blogosphere does very well, in my opinion, is catalogue economic thought. Which famous said what, when? And what did they mean by it?</div><div><br /></div>I'm bemused by how many libertarians are insistent on telling me, not only what I <i>should</i>&nbsp;think, but what I actually <i>do</i>&nbsp;think. (I would have thought that I am in a better position to decide. Apparently not.)<br /><div><br /></div><div>In general, I get the most value out of blogs where the authors themselves are active&nbsp;participants&nbsp;in the comments.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is a deep sense of peace in realising that you no longer need to reply to someone's latest comment because you have already won the argument.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the many earnest and highly intelligent layman that I have come across in the econ blogosphere, I can't think of any that have changed my fundamental views on my field. That's not to say that their aren't valid insights or criticisms, just that these have been better articulated within the profession itself. And, what's more, articulated long ago.</div><div><br /></div>
