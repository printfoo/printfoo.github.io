Hi! I’m Shan Jiang ([江](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_(surname)#%E6%B1%9F)[山](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_46)).

I study **(mis)information** as an ecosystem by observing the behaviors of its players. My work on this topic includes: understanding audiences' responses on social media ([CSCW'18a](publications/cscw18a_paper.pdf), [ICWSM'20](publications/icwsm20_paper.pdf)), auditing platforms' interventions such as content moderation ([ICWSM'19](publications/icwsm19_paper.pdf), [AAAI'20](publications/aaai20_paper.pdf)) and search ranking ([CSCW'18b](publications/cscw18b_paper.pdf)), structurizing fact-checkers' articles for search engines ([WWW'20](publications/www20_paper.pdf)), etc.

More broadly, I'm interested in (mostly) **computational social science** and (recently) **natural language processing**. Related work can be found in my [publications](publications).
