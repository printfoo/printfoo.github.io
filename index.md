Hi, My name is Shan Jiang. I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank"}, Boston. I'm very lucky to be advised by Professors [Christo Wilson](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cbw){:target="_blank"} and [Alan Mislove](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amislove){:target="_blank"}.

My current research focuses on [Algorithmic Auditing](http://personalization.ccs.neu.edu){:target="_blank"}. Briefly speaking, I'm trying to understand the human and socio-economic effects of pervasive machine learning algorithms, by performing large-scale data analysis for web services and mobile applications.

Before that, I received my B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China, and did my thesis at [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore. My undergraduate research mainly focused on [Network Economics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1282v1){:target="_blank"}.
