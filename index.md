Hello! I’m Shan Jiang, a second-year Ph.D. student at [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, Boston. I’m advised by two *amazing* professors, [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"} and [Alan Mislove](https://mislove.org){:target="_blank"}.

I’m interested in developing algorithmic methods to audit online platforms. Currently, I’m exploring how misinformations (rumor, “fake news”, etc.) spread on social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc.) and how crowds react to them. Previously, I studied [Google’s search results on hyperpartisan news sites](http://shanjiang.me){:target="_blank”}, and [accessibilities of Uber, Lyft and taxi services](http://shanjiang.me){:target="_blank”}. Broadly speaking, I work around Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing.

Before joining Northeastern, I received my B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China, and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore.
