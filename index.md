Hello! I’m Shan Jiang, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, Boston, MA. I’m very lucky to be advised by professor [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}.

My research is focused around **social computing** and **computational social science**. To examine these topics, I use a diverse set of tools, including statistical and causal inference, natural language processing, and machine learning. My recent work investigates human and algorithmic curation of misinformation. For more details, please check my [curriculum vitae](shanjiang-cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [research summary](research-summary.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

If you'd like to talk about my research or new project ideas, I'm always available at [sjiang@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:sjiang@ccs.neu.edu){:target="_blank"}.

Before joining Northeastern, I got my B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China from 2012 to 2016, and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore.
