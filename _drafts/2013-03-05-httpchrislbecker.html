Actually, getting involved in lengthy disputes is one reason we naturally avoid commenting regularly on each others' sites, I think. We'll make it a bi-annual thing then...  To avoid such endless confrontations, I'll leave some final general thoughts.   I used Friedman simply because his comment is so succinct and he provides a nice touchstone given his status in 20th century economics. The (ceteris paribus) relationship between money supply and prices has been understood by economists since at least the days of David Hume and Richard Cantillon. Further refinements (e.g. the role of interest rate) were obviously added by the likes of Wicksell in the 19th century that followed, but the theoretical basis certainly pre-dates Mises, Friedman and anyone else of the last 100 years.  What I certainly disagree with is that there is a mechanical relationship between money supply and inflation. Many Austrians badly misread this distinction and I would think that the many failed wolf cries of "hyperinflation!" remains a point of introspection for this group. Certainly, I wouldn't consider inflation a strong point among Austrian claims until this point. As for Zimbabwe, well let's just say that hyperinflation was the final symptom in economic malaise already triggered by staggering corruption and disastrous ZANU-PF policies.  I'll refrain from making comments on Mises' <i>Theory of Money and Credit</i> simply because I haven't read it. (Although, I wonder how of strongest supporters have? Of course, you could probably say the same for the works of Keynes and many other influential economists...) However, I do know that compelling evidence exists against the Austrian (i.e. Mengerian) version of the origins of money. This obviously seems to have have implications for the legitimacy of Mises' famed regression theorem, which directly builds on the work of Menger.  My thoughts on ABCT are that it constitutes, for the most part, a logically cogent theory and potential candidate for explaining parts of conventional business cycles. However, I believe that there are significant challenges to it from an empirical perspective (e.g. it implies some strange results w.r.t. to employment and consumption in the consumer goods and capital investment markets during the boom-bust phase), as well as from competing paradigms. I certainly don't consider it a general theory and when it comes to explaining longer downturns, such as the Great Depression, I think that it falls well short.[*] That's not to say that it has nothing useful to contribute, and the emphasis of intertemporal relationships in economic activity is certainly important.  The Austrian schism w.r.t. to fractional reserves is also very interesting. To quote <a href="http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/02/11/i-am-blaming-murray-rothbard-for-my-writers-block/#comment-2794">Steve Horowitz</a>, one of the pre-eminent Austrian scholars doing research today: "The vast majority of Austrian economists producing professional literature in economics reject the Rothbardian view of fractional reserve banking".  Cheers mate. ___ [*] If you are wondering, the most compelling diagnosis of the GD in my eyes comes from the Hawtrey-Cassel school of thought, which holds paramount the deflationary effects brought on by the international monetary demand for gold.
