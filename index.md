Hi, I’m Shan Jiang ([江](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_(surname)#%E6%B1%9F){:target="_blank"}[山](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_46){:target="_blank"}), a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank"}. I'm *happily and fortunately* advised by Professor [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}.

I work broadly around **computational journalism** and **computational social science**. Currently, my research investigates the **information quality** (or lack thereof) of human-generated content (e.g., news, misinformation, fact-checks) on the web, particularly under algorithmic curation (e.g., ranking, personalization).

During my Ph.D., I have interned with [Google AI](https://ai.google){:target="_blank"} in Summer 2019, and [Dataminr](https://www.dataminr.com){:target="_blank"} in Spring 2019. Before Ph.D., I got my B.B.A in Management Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} in 2016 and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}.

You can find more about me from my [résumé](shanjiang-resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [publications](publications). I'm on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LITOxAAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shan-jiang){:target="_blank"} and [GitHub](https://github.com/printfoo){:target="_blank"}. I also have a *very outdated* university [page](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/shan-jiang){:target="_blank"}.

I'm available at [sjiang@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:sjiang@ccs.neu.edu){:target="_blank"}.
