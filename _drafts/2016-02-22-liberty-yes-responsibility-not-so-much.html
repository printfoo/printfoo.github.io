I'm very late to party -- though I've been watching intently from the sidelines -- and will now offer my two cents on the whole Ron Paul newsletters palaver. (If you're unfamiliar with today's topic, then perhaps best stick this one out... Otherwise, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/grappling-with-ron-pauls-racist-newsletters/250206/">here</a> is as good a place to start as any.)<br /><br />As an unlikely political candidate in a country far from my own,&nbsp;Paul holds no direct relevance for me.&nbsp;However, he&nbsp;has come to personify something much larger than himself and is representative of a growing libertarian movement --&nbsp;largely&nbsp;in the US, but also present in other places around the world -- which may or may not peak in numbers before it reaches the necessary critical mass to truly affect public policy. I don't wish to debate the merits of&nbsp;libertarianism&nbsp;here; not least the particular brand that Paul espouses. For what it's worth, I am certainly very sympathetic to a number of his arguments, such as those on foreign policy and the asinine war on drugs. I even consider myself less authoritarian than him on the subject of immigration. (He proposes quite strict border controls, which runs counter to most notions of libertarianism that I am familiar with).&nbsp;On economics and some other issues, it's true, we would find a lot more to disagree on. I have no desire to return to a gold standard or repeal the practice of fractional reserve banking, while it appears that the gilded scales will never fall from Dr Paul's eyes.<br /><br />All that being said, I am interested in the ideas of freedom and prosperity, even to the extent that people might disagree over the fundamental meanings of those concepts. (See&nbsp;<a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/01/why-im-not-a-bleeding-heart-libertarian/">Will Wilkinson's excellent post</a>&nbsp;on this matter.) And, just as Paul is a now a symbol of some bigger movement, the bigotted ramblings in two-decades old newsletters hold greater significance<br /><br />Personally, what is in the newsletters has become something of a side issue. The response to them is what really gets to me.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4OOYOYRtNNU/TwoJUVoO8BI/AAAAAAAAALA/QrxsnwfH6Oo/s1600/Rothbard_Rockwell.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4OOYOYRtNNU/TwoJUVoO8BI/AAAAAAAAALA/QrxsnwfH6Oo/s1600/Rothbard_Rockwell.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Crouching tigers, circled wagons</td></tr></tbody></table>The&nbsp;surprisingly elusive question&nbsp;of who actually <i>wrote </i>the offensive pieces appears somewhat closer to being resolved -- &nbsp;at least to my mind.&nbsp;My growing suspicion over passed few months (recently fanned by <a href="http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2011/12/in-defense-of-the-mises-institute.html">Bob Murphy</a> and then all-but-comfirmed by&nbsp;<a href="http://gene-callahan.blogspot.com/2012/01/ron-paul-newsletters.html">Gene Callaghan</a>) is that the odious remarks were written, not by Lew Rockwell, but Murray Rothbard.[*]<br /><br />I initially thought that everyone in the Paul camp was being evasive -- or, worse, defensive -- because acknowledging those newsletters would be tantamount to admitting all those nasty things that the critics of libertarianism always claimed it was. That is, a self-serving ideology promoted by rich white bigots under false pretences that everyone stood a fair chance to do as well as them.<br /><br />And, I'm sorry, but saying you don't know who wrote them and disavow them simply isn't good enough.<br /><br />But herein lies the rub; no-one in the Paul party has been willing to cede some kind of responsibility about the matter.<br /><br />We're always told that freedom implies responsibility. The Paul camp has done far more damage to it's message by failing -- in every possible way to<br /><br /><br />[*] Just so my chips are all out on the table, I don't wish to give Rockwell a general reprieve.
