Hi, I’m Shan Jiang ([江](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_(surname)#%E6%B1%9F){:target="_blank”}[山](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_46){:target="_blank”}), a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, (happily and fortunately) advised by [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}.

I work broadly around **computational journalism** and **computational social science**. In particular, I'm currently investigating **information quality** on the web, including human-generated content (e.g., misinformation, fact-checks) and algorithmic curation (e.g., ranking, personalization).

During my Ph.D., I have interned with Google AI and Dataminr. Prior to Ph.D., I got my B.B.A in Management Information Systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and did my undergraduate thesis at National University of Singapore.

I'm also on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LITOxAAAAAJ){:target="_blank”}, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shan-jiang){:target="_blank”} and [GitHub](https://github.com/printfoo){:target="_blank”}.
