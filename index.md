I’m Shan Jiang, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, Boston, MA, advised by [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}. In Spring 2019, I'm a research intern at [Dataminr](https://www.dataminr.com){:target="_blank”}, New York, NY, advised by [Alejandro Jaimes](http://www.alexjaimes.com){:target="_blank"}.

My research broadly lies around **social computing** and **computational social science** using a diverse set of quantitative methods, including statistical and causal inference, natural language processing, machine learning, etc. My current work is focused on **human and algorithmically curated misinformation**. I'm available at [sjiang@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:sjiang@ccs.neu.edu){:target="_blank"}.

Before Northeastern, I got my B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China from 2012 to 2016, and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore.
