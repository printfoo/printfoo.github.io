### Statement from the Thesis Advisor 
> Christo Wilson is the head of the committee and Shan's primary PhD advisor. Shan's dissertation work focuses problems at the confluence of online algorithms and access to political information, including pressing issues such as hyperpartisan content, "fake news" and misinformation, and content moderation. Shan's work is based on observational measurements of real online platforms, an area that Alan Mislove is intimately familiar with. The political dimensions of Shan's work, including how people read and react to misinformation, are one facet of Miriam Metzger's expertise; she has a long track record of studying deception and how people navigate it. Shan's work combines empirical research methods with advanced machine learning and modeling techniques in the vein of computational social science, which are areas in which Abigail Evans is an expert. Alan Mislove and Miriam Metzger have both co-authored publications with Shan.
