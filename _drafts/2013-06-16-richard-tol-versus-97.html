I recently mentioned a paper by&nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article" target="_blank">Cook&nbsp;<i>et al</i>. (2013)</a>, which&nbsp;has received widespread attention for "quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW)". In short, Cook and his colleagues&nbsp;find overwhelming support (+/- 97%) for the theory of man-made climate change within the scientific literature.<br /><br />Of course, the qualitative results should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who isn't living in an alternate reality populated by the likes of Fox News and Alex Jones. Nevertheless, the paper has elicited a noisy response from the sceptic community. I'll get to that in a second, but first some important background on the Cook study, which has two distinct phases:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Phase 1:</b>&nbsp;The researchers analysed a sample of 11,944 papers related to climate change and rated them according to how strongly their abstracts reflected the AGW position. These are summarised in the following table:</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hdbuF7Y-6SQ/Ub35OGIGq7I/AAAAAAAAATg/mUbi7LqRmRE/s1600/Table_3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="136" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hdbuF7Y-6SQ/Ub35OGIGq7I/AAAAAAAAATg/mUbi7LqRmRE/s640/Table_3.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><ul><li><b>Phase 2:</b>&nbsp;The authors of the above studies were invited to rate their own papers (i.e. beyond that which might be implied by the abstract alone). As expected, not all the authors responded, but &nbsp;total of 2,142 papers were rated for this smaller subsample. Here's the relevant table:</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hxntjt_OqzA/Ub36hzKS8sI/AAAAAAAAATs/V2jNuUbKS9U/s1600/Table_4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hxntjt_OqzA/Ub36hzKS8sI/AAAAAAAAATs/V2jNuUbKS9U/s640/Table_4.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, so these two phases appear to reflect strikingly similar conclusions. However, there are some important differences between the full sample from Phase 1 and the smaller subsample from Phase 2. Most obviously, the author self-ratings show a much lower proclivity towards a "No position" stance (first column)...</div><div><br /></div>As I said, there has been a vigorous response to the Cook paper from the contrarian corners of the internet.&nbsp;For instance, a huge fuss was made about several papers that were ostensibly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/05/97-study-falsely-classifies-scientists.html" target="_blank">rated incorrectly</a>. That a cherry-picked subsample &nbsp;of N&lt;5 was being used to question the representivity of a sample totaling over ten thousand observations is almost beyond parody... But I suspect that statistical-based irony is beyond those making the claim.<br /><br />However, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bz17rNCpfuDNMU1GWERQdV9zUkk/edit" target="_blank">more interesting critique</a> has come in the form of the economist, Richard Tol. I should say upfront that Tol is not a climate sceptic and has a long history arguing for carbon taxes. (Although, I do find him to be&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/grant_mcdermott/status/320892177846775808" target="_blank">weirdly sycophantic</a>&nbsp;to the denial faction at times.) <br /><br />There has been a <a href="http://wottsupwiththatblog.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/richard-tols-fourth-draft/" target="_blank">looong discussion</a> taking place in the comments section of the Wottsupwiththat blog, which I have been involved in. I'll summarise the main takeaways from this conversation in my next blog.<br /><br /><br />
