#### [Hydro power. Market might.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTaWcxdHpsNE5wdjA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} (Job market paper)

*Hydropower is the world's foremost source of non-fossil fuel energy. It is also characterised by a unique set of production features that greatly simplify economic questions related to firm behaviour and output. Here I exploit these characteristics, together with quasi-experimental variation in market power and rich firm-level data, to identify evidence of noncompetitive behaviour in the Nordic electricity market. Consistent with theory, I find that increased market power leads to a dynamic pattern of resource shifting. Dominant firms tend to withhold production during inelastic demand periods, which would enable them to secure higher profits. My results suggest that even our most advanced electricity markets may be susceptible to manipulation under relatively common conditions.* ([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTaWcxdHpsNE5wdjA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>I test for evidence of strategic behaviour in an advanced power market using a rich and uniquely detailed dataset of Norwegian hydropower firms, reservoirs and electricity data. Changes to local bidding area divisions and binding transmission constraints provide the additional layers of exogenous variation that allow me to cleanly identify the causal effect of market power on firm behaviour over time. Consistent with theory, I find that increased market power leads to an intertemporal reallocation of water resources across periods. Dominant firms will tend to withhold production when demand is at its most inelastic. The effects are modest next to other factors governing reservoir management, such as annual snow-melt. Yet, they may still cause the production profile of hydropower firms to diverge in meaningful ways if the differences in market share are large enough, and particularly when transmission constraints are binding.</i>

#### [Sceptic priors and climate policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTcjRmZkNjMVhuVFU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

Under review.

*How much evidence would it take to convince climate sceptics that they are wrong about global warming? I explore this question within a Bayesian framework. I consider a group of stylised sceptics and examine how these individuals update their beliefs in the face of current and continuing climate change. I find that available evidence in the form of instrumental climate data already tends to overwhelm all but the most extreme priors. The resulting posterior distributions of climate sensitivity correspond closely to existing estimates from the scientific literature. The updated beliefs of most sceptics are thus consistent with a carbon price that is substantially greater than zero. However, belief convergence is a non-linear function of prior strength, so that it become increasingly difficult to convince the marginal sceptic. I conclude by discussing the general conditions for consensus formation under Bayesian learning, its relevance to our current policy impasse, and offer some remarks about finding common ground in the future.* ([Link to paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AgOxtQA9dTcjRmZkNjMVhuVFU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

## Works in progress

#### What would Thomas Edison have paid for Google?

With Christopher J. Costello and Michael B. Ward.

*A broad class of economic decision problems involves searching over a collection of uncertain research leads. Existing search theory informs the efficient search over this pool using available information. But in many cases, the researcher has the opportunity to collect new information en masse, e.g. with a search engine or scientific framework, that will benefit the search. We derive the value of this type of bulk information, determine the general properties that render it large or small, and calculate its implications for economic innovation. We show that changes to the underlying characteristics of different search problems can yield surprising results. For example, more lucrative end-prizes can actually reduce the value of information, while the possibility of better information often suppresses innovation.*

#### Protecting bycatch species by rebuilding global target fisheries

With Matthew G. Burgess and others.

*Rebuilding global target fisheries and protecting threatened bycatch species are central pillars of marine conservation efforts. Here, we assess the tradeoffs between these two objectives by comparing: (i) recent projections of changes in fishing pressure needed to achieve maximum yield or profit from 4,713 target fish stocks — accounting for &gt;75% of global catch — with (ii) estimates of changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse the ongoing declines of various sea turtle, marine mammal, and seabird populations threatened by fisheries bycatch. We project little-to-no tradeoff between maximizing fishery yields or profits and halting the declines in at least half of the bycatch populations in our sample. Tradeoff severity among the reminaing populations varies. Our results suggest that ending global overfishing would have substantial side-benefits for threatened bycatch species.*

#### The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine protected areas

With Christopher J. Costello and Kyle C. Meng.

#### [Five rules for pragmatic blue growth](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.005){:target="_blank"}

<!--
*The concept of blue growth is the newest of many recent calls for more holistic management of complex marine social-ecological systems. The complexity of ocean systems, combined with limitations on data and capacity, demands an approach to management that is pragmatic — meaning goal- and solution-oriented, realistic, and practical. Here we propose and discuss five rules of thumb upon which to build such an approach. 1) Define objectives, quantify tradeoffs, and strive for efficiency. Understanding stakeholders’ objectives, and if and how they trade off with one another, keeps management goal-oriented, aware of its full range of options, and maximizes the likelihood of finding win-win solutions. 2) The data you have can do more than you think. Cross-system similarity, within-system complexity, and general first principles all add informational value to data collected both within and outside the system being managed. 3) Engage stakeholders, but do it right. Co-management and citizen science can be important tools in the science and management toolbox, especially in data- and capacity-limited regions. 4) Measure your impact and learn as you go. This can increase short-term start-up costs but can prevent larger wastes of resources in the long-term. 5) Design institutions, not behaviors. Management does not directly control fishing efforts, pollution rates or other behaviors, but instead controls institutions under which stakeholders make choices. Each of these rules of thumb is inspired by real-world successes and case studies. We provide concrete examples to illustrate the key concepts and aim to provide a digestible set of guidelines that any manager can follow.*
