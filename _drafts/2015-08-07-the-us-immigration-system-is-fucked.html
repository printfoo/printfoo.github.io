This, as you will have gathered from the title, is going to be a rant.<br /><br />I recently accepted a job (postdoc) offer from a U.S. university. On paper, it's a pretty much an ideal opportunity. I am getting the chance to work with some of the leading researchers in my field. Colleagues who also happen to be great people. All set against the backdrop of a beautiful city along the Californian coast.<br /><br />And I'm tremendously happy about this. And I feel very lucky. Truly, I am and I do. But there is a sour taste at the back of my throat. And it<br /><br />Now, the US far from being alone in this. Part of the reason that my wife -- whom, I must emphasise, is a UK citizen -- and I decided not to move to UK was because of their own inane immigration rules. In particular, the Brits have made it virtually impossible for people in our situation to enter under a spousal visa. This is because of a bizarre proviso: Only the income of the Brit in the relationship is deemed relevant for meeting the financial/salary requirements of the visa. I'll say that again. It makes no difference whatsoever how much money I (i.e. a non-Brit) am paid. All that counts is how much my wife earns. Why? Well, who knows? The upshot, though, is that any British woman (or man) who decides to raise her children -- God forbid! -- rather than work alongside her partner will be unable to relocate back to her home country with her children.
