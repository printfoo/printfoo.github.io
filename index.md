Hello! I’m a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, Boston, MA. I’m very lucky to be advised by the **amazing** [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection between computer/web and human/society. I'm currently working on understanding the ecosystem of misinformation, from partisan and “fake” news to fact-checking and platform moderation. I'm also working on auditing bias in algorithmic systems. My research utilizes a toolbox of statistical and causal analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, etc.

Before joining Northeastern, I received my B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China, and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore.
