Hello! I’m a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu){:target="_blank”}, Boston, MA. I’m very lucky to be advised by professor [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh){:target="_blank"}.

My research lies around **social computing**, **computational social science** and (more broadly) **human-computer interaction** (HCI). My recent work takes an HCI perspective on the misinformation cycle. My research utilizes a diverse toolbox of statistical and causal inference, natural language processing, machine learning, etc. For more details, check my [curriculum vitae](shan-cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [research statement](shan-rs.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Before Northeastern, I studied B.B.A. in Information Management and Information Systems from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, China from 2012 to 2016, and did my undergraduate thesis at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore.
